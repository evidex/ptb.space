                                <p>The Initiative. was found in October 2008 by 3 former Pure Alliance corporations, Dawn Of A New Empire, Madhatters Inc. and Vanishing Point.</p>
                                <p>
										Vanishing Point and Madhatters Inc. shared their history up to the Branch War with MPIRE and F4T4L alliances against the NC while Dawn Of A New Empire shared a similar ideal to renew itself in creating something from scratch.
										While the decision was taken a few months before, the 3 corporations decided to wait for a more peaceful time to leave Pure Alliance in good terms but that time unfortunately never came. Pure was collapsing internally by lack of leadership and energy, lost most of Vale of the Silent in the MAX Campaign and was about to lose its part of Deklein, the leadership which changed during that time decided to evict without warning the 3 rogue-considered corporations that made no secrets of their leaving even though the 3 corporations still had more members combined fighting for their space.
										The 3 corporations regrouped in Venal NPC space to take the time to create the alliance and rebuild as their eviction left them with nothing except memories and kept strong contacts in the Northern Coalition. The alliance was officially created in October 2008. The ideals were to stay small and manageable while being effective. To reduce potential dramas coming from a council of 20+ CEOs and 40+ directors at the cost of potential fleet numbers and other capacities and to fully redistribute the wealth to its members rather than having it hoarded or personally held by dictator(s). 
										And finally, not to try and occupy vast areas of territory for sake of greed or pride. Two other corporations soon joined The Initiative: Druckwelle Evolution (Druckwelle and Minds Of Space who merged together) and STK Scientific, the latter also part of the Founders history during the Branch War.
										While still having a good relation with the Northern Coalition, that relation was always tensed in the lower hierarchic levels. The Initiative. had a good run in Venal and under the NC umbrella eventually settled in the former Pure home Vale Of The Silent.
										The Initiative. got praised by both enemies and friends in the ED/IRC campaign in which they helped Red Alliance take and hold a part of Etherium Reach. That campaign included a titan kill by only subcaps ships. Back home in Venal, Triumvirate was slowly removing small INIT. assets and the NC decided that it was time to evict Triumvirate from their neighborhood... again. One last corporation joined after and because of the ED/IRC campaign: DEFCON.
										After the removal of Triumvirate from Venal by the NC, the leadership was struggling on a certain status quo of their situation both for the alliance and their role in the NC which led to the question: "Do we leave the North or not?" The answer was unanimous.
										In early Summer 2009, The Initiative started to dismantle their infrastructures in Vale of the Silent and warned the NC that they were leaving and doing a complete reset. An opportunity arose at the same time in the south and the migration began.
										The Initiative. is currently living in the south..</p>
